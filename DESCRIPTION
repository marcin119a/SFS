Description: The package include both a function \emph{NMFPois}, that finds an initial non-negative matrix factorization(NMF) 
  and a function \emph{sampleSFS} that can recover the whole set of feasible solutions given an initial solution. 
  Other than that there is a function used to convert the results into SVD representtion \emph{samplesToSVD}.
